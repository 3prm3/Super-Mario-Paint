As you all know, this is a beta release, so bugs and issues are to be expected.
Here is a list of currently-known bugs:

-Running a song above 5000 tempo may cause random lines to be skipped once in a
while if your computer isn't fast enough. This is an efficiency problem that 
may have to be sorted out over time and many iterations.
[FIXED, v1.0.0]

-End-of-file behaviour seems to be solved, but keep a lookout.

-Christeriousninja / VolcanBrimstone: The soundfont is missing a number of 
notes in the boat instrument. Some boat notes will not sound because of that.

-Axelrod777: Cannot use the Mochi soundfont - sound effects are currently 
messed up.

-VolcansBrimstone: Arranger path issues (cannot play arrangements in some cases
if moved from a directory) - need to edit code to address absolute vs relative
paths.
[FIXED, v1.0.0]
