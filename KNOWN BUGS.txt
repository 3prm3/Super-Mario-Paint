As you all know, this is an alpha release, so bugs and issues are to be expected.
Here is a list of currently-known bugs:

-Release note: The arranger mode does not work yet!!
-(MrGudtavosky) The play bar / highlighter bar will apparently sometimes get 'stuck' in a place. Restarting the program will fix this (it's not permanent)
-End-of-file behaviour seems to be solved, but keep a lookout.
-(Christeriousninja / VolcanBrimstone) The soundfont is missing a number of notes in the boat instrument. Some boat notes will not sound because of that.
